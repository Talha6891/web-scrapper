# Web Scrapper

![Sample Image](public/images/sample-image.png)

This repository contains a Node.js script that uses Puppeteer and Axios to scrape images from a specified webpage and save them locally. The script fetches all images found in `<img>` tags on the page and stores them in a local directory.

## Features

- **Scrapes Image URLs**: Extracts image URLs from all `<img>` tags on the webpage.
- **Downloads Images**: Fetches and saves the images to a local directory.
- **Handles Directory Creation**: Ensures that the directory for storing images is created if it does not exist.
- **Custom User-Agent**: Uses a browser-like User-Agent to avoid detection and restrictions by the website.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Talha6891/web-scrapper.git

## Usage

1. **Open the `index.js` file** and set the `url` variable to the webpage you want to scrape.

- **Puppeteer Setup**: Launches a browser instance, sets a User-Agent, and navigates to the specified URL.
- **Image Extraction**: Collects image URLs from the webpage.
